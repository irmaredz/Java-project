This fitness centre has three outlets: Club Mercury, Club Neptune and Club Jupiter. 

It also has two types of members: Single Club Members and Multi Club Members.

A single club member has access to only one of the three clubs. A multi club member, on the other hand, has access to all three clubs.

The membership fee of a member depends on whether he/she is a single club or a multi club member. For single club members, the fees also depend on 
which club he/she has access to.

Finally, multi club members are awarded membership points for joining the club. Upon sign up, they are awarded 100 points which they can use to 
redeem gifts and drinks from the store.
